- **Confirm Password**: Re-enter the password to confirm it matches the one you entered above.
- **Email**: Please make sure to enter a valid email address. This is crucial as it will be used for account verification and communication purposes. Ensure that the email address you're using is not already associated with an existing account on our platform. Additionally, note that if your email's storage capacity has approached its limit, you may not receive the confirmation email.
- **Captcha**: Complete the captcha to verify that you're a real person and not a bot.

**Step 3: Verify Your Email**

After submitting the sign-up form, you'll receive a confirmation email at the address you provided. It's important to enter your email correctly to ensure you receive this email.

**Step 4: Check Your Email Inbox**

Open your email inbox and look for the confirmation email from our website. If you don't see it in your inbox, be sure to check your spam or junk folder as it may have been filtered there.

**Step 5: Click the Confirmation Link**

In the email, you'll find a link to confirm your account. Click on this link to verify your email address and activate your account. Alternatively, you may need to copy the confirmation link and paste it into your web browser's address bar.

**Why You Might Not Receive the Confirmation Email**

If you don't receive the confirmation email within a few minutes, there are a few reasons why this might happen:

- **Incorrect Email Address**: Double-check that you entered your email address correctly on the sign-up form.
- **Spam or Junk Folder**: The email may have been filtered into your spam or junk folder. Check these folders to see if it's there.
- **Delays**: Sometimes, email delivery can be delayed due to server issues or high traffic. Wait a few minutes and check again.
- **Email Storage Limit**: If your email's storage has approached its limit, you may not receive new emails until you free up space.

If you're still having trouble receiving the confirmation email, you can contact our support team for assistance.
