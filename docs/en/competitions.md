# Participation

After registering, participants must wait until the competition begins. There are two possibilities for the start of the competition:

1. **Simultaneous Start:** Everyone begins their participation in the competition at the same time.
2. **Open Interval:** The competition is open for several days or hours, during which users can start their participation at any suitable time. However, if a user starts less than x hours before the competition ends, where x is the participation length, the competition will be closed for everyone simultaneously.

The **format** of competition always announced **before the competition**!


# Submissions

Once the participation begins, users can access the list of problems and start working on them. Each problem statement can be viewed by clicking on the respective problem in the task list. Users can then write their submissions in the Code Editor and submit them. The results of the submission will be displayed automatically in the "Submissions" section. Users can close this section by clicking on "Submissions" again.
